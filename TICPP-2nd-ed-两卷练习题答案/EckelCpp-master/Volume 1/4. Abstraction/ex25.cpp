/**
Repeat Exercise 24, but put the functions inside a struct instead of using "raw" structs and functions.

Exercise 24:
Create a struct that holds an int and a pointer to another instance
of the same struct. Write a function that takes the address of one of
these structs and an int indicating the length of the list you want
created. This function will make a whole chain of these structs
(a linked list), starting from the argument (the head of the list),
with each one pointing to the next. Make the new structs using new,
and put the count (which object number this is) in the int. In the
last struct in the list, put a zero value in the pointer to indicate
that itâ€™s the end. Write a second function that takes the head of
your list and moves through to the end, printing out both the pointer
value and the int value for each one.
