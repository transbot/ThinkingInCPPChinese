Write a program that takes three command-line arguments
(a filename and two strings) and displays to the console
all lines in the file that have both strings in the line,
either string, only one string, or neither string, based
on user input at the beginning of the program (the user
will choose which matching mode to use). For all but
the "neither string" option, highlight the input string(s)
by placing an asterisk (*) at the beginning and end of
each stringâ€™s occurrence when it is displayed.
