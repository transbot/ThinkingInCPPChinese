C++ strings dynamically and transparently grow their internal data storage 
space to accommodate increases in the size of the string data. when the data 
in a string grows beyond the limits of the memory initially allocated to it, 
the string object will make the memory management calls that take space from 
and return space (to the heap). consistent allocation schemes prevent memory 
leaks! and have the potential to be much more efficient than "roll your own" 
memory management.
