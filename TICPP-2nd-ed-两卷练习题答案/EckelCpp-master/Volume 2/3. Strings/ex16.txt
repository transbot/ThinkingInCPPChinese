Write a program that accepts two command-line arguments
(a filename and a number) and scrambles each word in the
file by randomly switching two of its letters the number
of times specified in the second argument. (That is, if 0
is passed into your program from the command-line, the
words should not be scrambled; if 1 is passed in, one
pair of randomly-chosen letters should be swapped, for an
input of 2, two random pairs should be swapped, etc.).
