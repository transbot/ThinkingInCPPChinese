Using the characters generate a codebook using an input file 
given on the command line as a dictionary of words. Donâ€™t worry 
about stripping off the non-alphabetic characters nor worry about
case of the words in the dictionary file. Map each permutation
of the character string to a word such as the following: etc.
Make sure that no duplicate codes or words exist in your code book.
Use lexicographical_compare() to perform a sort on the codes.
Use your code book to encode the dictionary file. Decode your
encoding of the dictionary file, and make sure you get the same
contents back.
